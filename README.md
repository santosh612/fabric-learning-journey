**Fabric Learning and Data Engineering Portfolio (Dec 2025 – Jan 2026)**
This repository documents my structured preparation for the **Microsoft Fabric Data Engineer Certification (DP-700)** and my hands-on development of end-to-end data engineering solutions using Microsoft Fabric. The purpose is to build a strong technical foundation, maintain a consistent learning process, and demonstrate applied data engineering capabilities.
________________________________________
Objectives
1.	Develop comprehensive understanding of Microsoft Fabric architecture and components.
2.	Build practical skills in Lakehouse design, ingestion pipelines, transformations, and data modeling.
3.	Implement reproducible data engineering workflows using Notebooks (PySpark), Dataflows Gen2, and Data Factory pipelines.
4.	Create production-style mini projects to strengthen my technical portfolio.
5.	Prepare thoroughly for the DP-700 certification with daily structured learning and weekly assessments.
6.	Maintain version-controlled documentation for long-term reference and portfolio visibility.
